Relation tuples are the underlying datatype of ORY Keto's access control
language. They encode relations between objects and subjects. A relation tuple
is associated with a namespace where its relation has to be defined and
configured. The following BCNF grammar describes the encoding used in the
documentation and within ORY Keto. Note that `namespace` is often omitted in
examples for readability.

```
<relation-tuple> ::= <object>'#'relation'@'<subject>
<object> ::= namespace':'object_id
<subject> ::= subject_id | <subject_set>
<subject_set> ::= <object>'#'relation
```

A relation tuple

```keto-relation-tuples
object#relation@subject
```

can be translated into the english
sentence "Subject has relation on object".
